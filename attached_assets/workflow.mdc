# 📊 Workflow Implementation

## Execution Flow

The project implements a modular workflow with multiple agents coordinated through integration hubs:

```
Ideation ──┬──▶ Character ────┐
           ├──▶ World-Building├──▶ Central Integration ──▶ Outlining ──▶ Writing ──▶ Iterative Review ──▶ Revision ──▶ Editorial ──▶ Final Manuscript
           └──▶ Research ─────┘
```

## Key Workflow Principles

1. **Parallel Execution**: Character, World-Building, and Research agents run concurrently
2. **Central Integration**: Minimal data integration at clearly defined hubs
3. **Iterative Loops**: Clear feedback loops between Writing, Iterative Review, and Revision 

## LangGraph Implementation

The workflow is implemented using LangGraph for orchestration, which enables:

- Non-linear, parallel execution paths
- Conditional branching based on agent outputs
- Visualization of the entire workflow
- Monitoring of execution progress

When implementing workflow components, ensure proper integration with the LangGraph orchestration system and maintain the parallel execution model where appropriate.
